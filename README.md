### gbdfed-1.6.tar.bz2: Source code for gbdfed v1.6 by Mark Leisher.

Used to be in http://sofia.nmsu.edu/~mleisher/Software/gbdfed/ but the source is gone.

- gbdfed is a GTK-based BDF font editor. It can import:
  - Metafont PK/GF fonts
  - Han Bitmap Font Format (HBF) fonts
  - Linux console (PSF, CP, and EGA/VGA) fonts
  - Sun VF fonts, OpenType (OTF & TTF) fonts
  Alternatively it can load a font from the X server. Export is supported to PSF2 Linux console fonts and HEX fonts.

  References to the file in https://www.freshports.org/x11-fonts/gbdfed/ match the SHA-256: `5db25d4ce688dcb188dee056e58614a94a5e4fce4b6066fbb310951ab999093c` and size of 236,166 bytes.

Enjoy,
